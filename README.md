# Ohedo : 3D Game Engine written in C

A simple engine in its very first stages of becoming a, game engine or just a framework for making games using OpenGL.

Here are the features of Ohedo for now:

- OpenGL 4.1 wrappers (VAO, VBO, EBO, Shader)
- Window creation
- Simple event callback system
- Build system with CMake
  
What I am going to implement :
- Textures
- Model loading
- Cube Maps
- Custom Shading
- Advanced input polling
- UI library
